## Description

This repository contains the code and scripts used in the analyses for the above-mentioned article. The study aimed to characterise the genetics of Beauce’s population and to investigate how its structure can be explained by the demographic processes using deep genealogies.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains two branches : 
- **Genealogical_analyses** contains the scripts and documentation related to the genealogical analyses performed
- **Genetic_analyses** contains the scripts and documentation related to the ancestry-based clustering of the genotyped data and the identification rare pathogenic variants with an elevated frequency in Beauce due to the regional founder effect.

Both branches also contain the aggregated data necessary to reproduce the main Figures
